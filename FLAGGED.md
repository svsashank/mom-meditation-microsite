The ~10 lowest-confidence judgment calls from Phase 1 (skills + longlist).
These are where a reasonable reviewer might overrule me. Ordered roughly by
risk. Cross-references are to `DECISIONS.md`.

---

**F1 — Extent of the banned-phrases list (→ A3).** *Editorial.* I extended the
brief's explicit bans ("cures/treats/heals") to a wider wellness-cliché register
(boosts, rewires, detoxes, "clinically proven," exclamation points, second-person
health promises). This reflects §3's voice rules, but the exact line between
"banned" and "discouraged" is a call the content owner should confirm. Low harm
risk; easy to relax.

**F2 — Semantic Scholar not used this pass (→ B1).** *Coverage.* The brief names
Semantic Scholar + PubMed. Semantic Scholar's API returned empty responses in
this environment, so the longlist is PubMed-derived only. PubMed's coverage of
peer-reviewed biomedical meditation research is strong, but preprints and some
psychology/CS-venue app studies indexed by Semantic Scholar may be missing. Rerun
with a working Semantic Scholar key before the final 100 to close gaps.

**F3 — Meditation-relevance gate on BIDMC affiliation results (→ B6).** *Highest-
judgment call.* The Sadhguru Center sits inside BIDMC anesthesiology, so its
members co-author perioperative/critical-care papers unrelated to meditation. I
dropped 20 such affiliation-only items and kept 13 meditation/Isha ones. If the
intent was to showcase the Center's full output (not just its meditation work),
this is wrong and should be reversed. My read of §4 is that alignment governs, so
I filtered — but this is the call most worth a human eye.

**F4 — RCR as the "normalized citation" metric (→ B2).** *Methodological.* I used
iCite's Relative Citation Ratio as the impact signal. RCR is field- and
time-normalized, which I judged closer to the brief's intent than raw counts, but
it is an NIH-specific metric with known limitations for very new or
non-biomedical papers. A reviewer may prefer a simpler citations-per-year or a
percentile approach.

**F5 — Longlist is meta-analysis-heavy: 159/292 (→ B3, B10).** *Balance.* The
tier score rewards the top of the evidence hierarchy, so systematic reviews and
meta-analyses dominate. That is defensible for a longlist, but the final 100 —
especially the 20-slot "brain & mechanisms" theme, which §5 says is scored
separately — needs deliberate inclusion of primary neuroimaging/mechanistic
studies. Not yet done.

**F6 — Some top-ranked papers study yoga/mindfulness as one arm of a broader
review (→ B4).** *Alignment strength.* Highly-cited overviews (e.g. non-invasive
low-back-pain treatments, physician-burnout interventions) rank high because they
are meta-analyses that include a yoga/mindfulness component, not because they
study a MoM-adjacent practice directly. They pass the alignment test loosely.
Curation to 100 should prefer studies whose primary intervention is the
meditation/breath practice.

**F7 — Yogic-weighting magnitude (+2.0 bonus + dedicated queries) (→ B4).**
*Calibration.* The brief says weight yogic research UP but doesn't specify how
much. 52% of the longlist is now yogic-weighted. If that over-represents yogic
practice relative to the evidence base the reviewer wants surfaced, the bonus can
be reduced. The direction is per §4; the size is my calibration.

**F8 — Theme assignment is single-primary (→ B7).** *Taxonomy.* Many papers span
themes (e.g. an HRV study of a stress intervention is both "stress" and "brain").
I assigned one primary theme by priority order for the distribution math; the
`all_themes` column preserves the rest. Papers may therefore sit under a theme a
reviewer would file differently.

**F9 — Null/critical detection is keyword-based (→ B8).** *Recall risk.* I flagged
null/mixed and critical-methodology papers via title/abstract keywords
("no significant," "risk of bias," etc.). This will miss null results that are
phrased less explicitly, and the count (34) is a floor, not a census. The single
"major critical review" the brief requires is not yet individually chosen.

**F10 — Recency cutoff / 2026 papers with thin citation data (→ B2).** *Data
maturity.* The pool includes 2025–2026 papers that have little or no citation
history, so their impact score rests on the fallback proxy or is near zero. A few
may be ranked lower than their eventual importance warrants (or included on
recency alone). Worth a second look at the newest entries during curation.
